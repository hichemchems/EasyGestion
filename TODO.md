# TODO: Fix Login and Routing Issues

## Plan Steps
1. Verify that the frontend login correctly calls the backend /auth/login and handles the response.
2. Ensure the JWT token is stored and used for authenticated requests.
3. Confirm the frontend routing redirects users to the correct dashboard based on their role after login.
4. Check the ProtectedRoute component to handle unauthorized access and redirect properly.
5. Investigate the "Route not found" message sourceâ€”whether from backend API or frontend route.
6. Optionally, add a frontend route for /unauthorized to handle unauthorized access gracefully.
7. Test the full login and navigation flow to reproduce and fix any issues.
