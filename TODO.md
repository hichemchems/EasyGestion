# TODO.md - Changes Made to EasyGestion Project

## 1. Fixed Circular Dependency in backend/routes/receipts.js
- **Change**: Removed the top-level `const { io } = require('../index');` and added lazy loading `const { io } = require('../index');` inside each route handler that uses `io.emit`.
- **Why**: There was a circular dependency between `backend/index.js` (which requires routes) and `backend/routes/receipts.js` (which required index for io). This caused a warning: "Accessing non-existent property 'io' of module exports inside circular dependency". Lazy loading ensures the module is fully loaded before accessing io.

## 2. Fixed Sequelize Association in backend/models/index.js
- **Change**: Added `as: 'employee'` to the `Goal.belongsTo(Employee, { foreignKey: 'employee_id', as: 'employee' });` association.
- **Why**: The scheduler in `backend/scheduler.js` was using `include: [{ model: Employee, as: 'employee' }]`, but the association was defined without the alias, causing Sequelize to expect 'Employee' (capital E) instead of 'employee'. This resulted in EagerLoadingError during the daily alert job.

## 3. Fixed Frontend API URL in docker-compose.yml
- **Change**: Changed `REACT_APP_API_URL` from `http://backend:5000/api/v1` to `http://localhost:5002/api/v1`.
- **Why**: The frontend is accessed on the host at `http://localhost:3001`, so it needs to call the backend on the host port `5002` (mapped from container port 5000). The previous URL `http://backend:5000` is only resolvable inside the Docker network, not from the host browser.

## 4. Fixed Frontend Port Consistency
- **Change**: Updated `frontend/Dockerfile` to `EXPOSE 3001`, and `docker-compose.yml` to set `PORT: 3001` and ports mapping `"3001:3001"`.
- **Why**: The frontend console was showing `http://localhost:3000` (internal container port), but the user accesses it on `http://localhost:3001` (host port). This change makes the console display the correct host port for consistency.

## 5. Fixed CORS Configuration
- **Change**: Updated `backend/index.js` to allow CORS from both `http://localhost:3000` and `http://localhost:3001` for express and socket.io.
- **Why**: The frontend is now running on port 3001, but the backend CORS was only allowing 3000, causing 404 errors on API calls.

## Note on Frontend Port
- The frontend now runs on port 3001 inside the Docker container and is mapped to the same port on the host.
- You access it at `http://localhost:3001` from your browser, and the console now correctly shows `http://localhost:3001`.
- This is configured in `docker-compose.yml` with `"3001:3001"` and `PORT: 3001`.
## 6. Fixed Admin Registration 404 Error
- **Issue**: POST request to `/api/v1/admin` was returning 404 "Route not found" due to CORS preflight failure.
- **Root Cause**: CORS configuration used an array of origins with `credentials: true`, which doesn't work for preflight OPTIONS requests. The cors package requires a function for origin validation when using credentials. Additionally, the OPTIONS preflight request was not being handled properly for the specific route, and allowedHeaders needed to be specified for multipart requests.
- **Fix Applied**: 
  - Updated CORS configuration in `backend/index.js` to use a function that checks allowed origins for both express and socket.io, and added allowedHeaders for content-type.
  - Added explicit OPTIONS handler in `backend/routes/admin.js` to respond to preflight requests.
- **Verification**: Tested endpoint with curl - POST works. Frontend should now be able to register admin successfully.

## 7. Verification Steps for CRUD Operations and Creation Forms

- [x] **Migrations and Seeds**: Verified - All tables exist with correct schemas via DESCRIBE commands.
- [x] **Data Integrity**: Verified - All table schemas match model expectations (e.g., Users has siret/phone/logo_path, Employees has user_id, etc.).

### End-to-End Testing
- [x] **API Testing**: Verified basic endpoints - GET /api/v1/admin/test returns success, GET /api/v1/packages returns empty array, protected routes like GET /api/v1/expenses require auth token.
- [ ] **Frontend Testing**: Use browser to test forms, ensure no errors in console, data persists.
- [ ] **Socket.IO**: For receipts, verify real-time updates work.
- [x] **Authentication**: Verified - protected routes return "Access token required" without JWT.
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Verify proper error responses for invalid data.

### General Checks
- [x] **CORS**: Verified - backend/index.js allows origins ["http://localhost:3000", "http://localhost:3001"] with credentials: true.
- [x] **Validation**: Verified - backend validation matches frontend (password regex, SIRET length, etc.).
- [ ] **File Uploads**: For forms with files (e.g., logo), verify multer handles uploads correctly.
- [ ] **Scheduler**: Verify daily alert job runs without errors.

### Testing Options and Execution
- [ ] Decide on testing level: Proceed with critical-path testing (key elements only, like admin creation and main CRUD).
- [ ] **Critical-Path Testing Steps**:
  - [ ] Test Admin Registration: POST /api/v1/admin with valid data, verify DB save, auto-login.
  - [ ] Test Admin CRUD: GET, PUT, DELETE /api/v1/admin.
  - [ ] Test Auth: Login with created admin, verify JWT.
  - [ ] Test Main Entities CRUD: Users, Employees, Packages, Receipts, Expenses, Salaries, Goals (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE for each).
  - [ ] Test Frontend Forms: Admin registration form, login form, and any creation forms for main entities.
  - [ ] Test Database Links: Verify data persistence and associations (e.g., Goals with Employees).
  - [ ] Test End-to-End: Browser test for admin creation flow, API calls via curl.

## 8. Add Confirm Password Validation to Admin Registration
- **Change**: Update `backend/routes/admin.js` to add validation for the 'confirmPassword' field in the admin registration endpoint. Add a custom validator to ensure 'confirmPassword' matches 'password' before hashing and saving the user.
- **Why**: The curl command includes 'confirmPassword', but the backend currently ignores it, which could lead to registration with mismatched passwords if not validated. This ensures password confirmation is enforced on the server side, improving security and user experience by preventing accidental mismatches.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Add `body('confirmPassword').custom((value, { req }) => { if (value !== req.body.password) { throw new Error('Password confirmation does not match password'); } return true; })` to `adminRegisterValidation`.
  - No additional dependencies needed; uses existing express-validator.
- **Verification**: Test POST /api/v1/admin with matching and non-matching passwords to ensure validation works.

## 9. Verify Admin Registration Parameters and Database Storage
- **Issue**: User reported that admin registration is still failing ("sa beug encore"). Need to verify all parameters are correctly handled in the backend and stored in the database.
- **Parameters to Check**:
  - `name`: Stored as `username` in User model
  - `email`: Stored as `email` in User model
  - `siret`: Stored as `siret` in User model (added via migration)
  - `phone`: Stored as `phone` in User model (added via migration)
  - `password`: Hashed and stored as `password_hash` in User model
  - `confirmPassword`: Validated but not stored (only used for validation)
  - `logo`: Optional file upload, stored as `logo_path` in User model
- **Database Model Verification**: User model includes all fields (username, email, password_hash, role, siret, phone, logo_path)
- **Migration Verification**: Migration `20251004221638-add-admin-fields-to-users.js` adds siret, phone, logo_path columns
- **Route Verification**: POST /api/v1/admin correctly maps to admin.js router.post('/', ...)
- **Validation Verification**: All fields validated, including confirmPassword match
- **File Upload Verification**: Multer handles multipart/form-data, logo file moved to uploads/logos/
- **Response Verification**: Returns 201 with user data on success, 400 on validation error, 500 on server error
- **Testing**: Use corrected curl command without manual Content-Type header
